## Disclaimer

By using this tool, you acknowledge that YOU are using discord's API, and take the risks for potential bans (due to rate limiting).

## Description

StarSpammer is a trolling tool with a command-line interface used to spam discord webhooks. You can set the limit to how many messages you want, and the message content you want to send*.

## Tutorial
# Command

`python main.py -wh WEBHOOK_URL -msgamt AMOUNT_OF_MESSAGES -cont MESSAGE_CONTENT`

# Tutorial

1. Run the command
2. Replace `WEBHOOK_URL` with the url of the webhook
3. Replace `AMOUNT_OF_MESSAGES` with the amount of messages (in integers)
4. Replace `MESSAGE CONTENT` with the content of the message *the-message-has-to-be-sent-with-no-spaces-(like-this), and with no embeds (but you can send gifs/urls)
5. Click enter!

# notes

[] add inf messages
[] fix the no spaces problem
